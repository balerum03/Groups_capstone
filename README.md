# Group our transations.
This project is a simple app built using basic Ruby on Rails functionalities in this app you can create an account, and when logged in, you can create   groups and items to help you organize the items that you need to buy for a specific place or purpose.
For example: if you need to buy milk, you can create the group kitchen and say that you need milk by creating the item milk.
